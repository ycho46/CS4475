# CS4475
CS 4475 Computational Photography

This is my final project for CS 4475 Computational Photography.
The project captures user's portrait image from the webcam using face detection.
It automatically converts the captured images into a cartoonized image.
As the image is converted it will be saved for each step in the pipeline of the converting process.

You can run this by downloading the repository and running the capture.py file by using the command

"python capture.py haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml"

To capture the screen you can hit "ctrl + c" on the command line to terminate the program and it will capture
the image and convert as the program terminates.
The captured and converted images will be saved in the same directory.

Lastly, "CS4475FINAL.key" file is the keynote of my final project.
The PDF is the submiited final report for the project
